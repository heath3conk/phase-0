## My website Pt. 1 reflection

Link to my website's repo on GitHub: https://github.com/heath3conk/heath3conk.github.io.git

*Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.*
 - Click the **+** sign near the top right corner of the GitHub screen and choose **New repository**.
 - Name your repository something...GitHub will suggest a name if you can't come up with one. 
 - Decide whether to make your repo public or keep it private, whether to include a **README** file and whether and what kind of license you want to attach to it.
 - Click the **Creat repository** button.
 - From inside the new repo on GitHub, find the section that has the URL and copy it. Open your terminal and enter **git clone [URL]**.

*Describe what open source means.* Anyone can see and change the code.

*What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?* I'm a pragmatic optimist. I think it's generally a fine idea to allow others to view and possibly change (hopefully to improve) my code...particularly considering I'm such a novice at the moment. There's always the potential that somebody could, intentially or otherwise, destroy my work. That makes me a little nervous but (here's the pragmatist) since I'm keeping up-to-date copies of everything locally, I can always reinstate what I had. 

Outside of that worst-case scenario, I like the idea of collaborative coding. People approach problems in different ways and those disparate perspectives can be beneficial. I doubt it's utopia, though.  

*Assess the importance of using licenses.*
Licenses are for self-protection. Depending on the specific license you choose, you can regulate the circumstances under which other people can use your work. The loosest license allows people to use it for pretty much any purpose while more strict licenses require that anyone using your code has to reference your original code and may prevent others from selling your work without telling their buyers that they can get it for free from you.

*What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?* My biggest takeaway from this challenge was the repetition of the process of making changes and pushing them up to GitHub. It worked on the first try and I am definitely getting more comfortable with that process. Probably just need to do it 50 more times to feel like I REALLY know it.

*Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.* None on this one.
