# Week 1 Reflections

## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I started at the top and read the post about mindfulness and then downloaded Headspace and did 10 minutes of meditation. Then I re-read the instructions, which cautioned against such rabbit holes until after a more thorough examination of the available material. :) I watched the video about the Pomodoro technique, which I have actually used in the past, read about habits and the growth mindset, learning Ruby the Hard Way, the Fogg method, making it big by starting small, counter-intuitive methods for increasing productivity, flow and timeboxing. 

Timeboxing is deciding to focus on a project or task for a specific period of time rather than setting a milestone and working until achieving it, however long it takes. With timeboxing, the individual or team may work for relatively short periods of time (pomodoro advocates 25 minutes of focused activity) and includes time for reviewing the work that's been done in that particular block of time.

I have typically managed work, not time. I have x projects to accomplish today so I estimate the time each will take and decide on the order to work on each one. I may or may not take breaks in the middle of a task. If a task takes longer than expected, I sometimes just keep hammering away, depending on whether I'm working to a deadline and/or think I'm close to finishing it. 

My strategy works...most of the time. If I'm way off on my estimates, I might get completely derailed and end up not finishing three things because one of them took a lot longer than I thought it would.

I like the idea from the counter-intuitive methods of increasing productivity blog about working on the things that interest me. I'm here to begin with because I think coding will be interesting. If I want to spend an hour reading the Learn Ruby the Hard Way book, that's productive time. If I want to take 10 minutes a day to meditate, that (apparently) will also be productive. I have the time and, since everything here is new, I can wallow a bit in the sense of shiny and interesting. Not to the exclusion of assignments, naturally, but...just because something may be separate from an assigned challenge, doesn't mean it's a waste of time.

Also, I know that I'm most productive before noon and between 2 and 4pm. My plan is to spend that time working on challenges, when my brain is working most effectively, and then pursue other interesting things outside of those periods.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an interface that lets you interact more directly with the computer. It feels like the smallest step between me and the processor without any filtering program like file explorer. Bash is specific shell program.

The most challenging thing for me was just getting used to the idea of performing actions on my computer without those filtering programs. Most applications will protect me from myself but it feels like there are fewer safety features with shell. It felt like I was working without a net...until I got a permissions error on the first command. Apparently, there are some deeper safety protocols at work.

I was able to use all the commands without much trouble besides the occasional typo.

Since I'm still feeling my way around in the shell, it seems like the pwd, ls and cd commands are the most important. They'll tell me where I am and what's in here with me and let me move around. It's also good to know how to create files and directories so I can get stuff done. 

The commands are:

 - pwd = print working directory

 - ls = list contents of current directory

 - mv = move file

 - cd = change directory

 - ../ = with cd, means to go up one level in the current path

 - touch = create a new, empty file

 - mkdir = create a new directory

 - less = page through a text file

 - rmdir = remove a directory (only if it's empty)

 - rm = remove a file

 - help = finds information in man about a command

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repository locally, navigate to the directory in which you want your new repo to live and type *git init repo-name* in the command line. To fork a repository from GitHub, click on the "fork" button near the top right corner of the screen. That will put the forked copy into your own account. To clone it to your local drive, copy the URL, navigate in the terminal to the appropriate directory, type *git clone* and paste the URL.

The reason to fork a repository rather than creating a new one is to have all the material that's in the existing repo available (a) without having to copy each item individually and (b) avoiding the possibility of messing up anything that's in the original.

It was a bit terrifying at first deleting the forked repo on GitHub! I'm really enjoying using the terminal for this stuff - makes me feel like I actually know what I'm doing (sometimes). I just realized that these two reactions are the flip sides of a coin, which is kind of interesting.
