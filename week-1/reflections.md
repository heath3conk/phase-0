# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I started at the top and read the post about mindfulness and then downloaded Headspace and did 10 minutes of meditation. Then I re-read the instructions, which cautioned against such rabbit holes until after a more thorough examination of the available material. :) I watched the video about the Pomodoro technique, which I have actually used in the past, read about habits and the growth mindset, learning Ruby the Hard Way, the Fogg method, making it big by starting small, counter-intuitive methods for increasing productivity, flow and timeboxing. 

Timeboxing is deciding to focus on a project or task for a specific period of time rather than setting a milestone and working until achieving it, however long it takes. With timeboxing, the individual or team may work for relatively short periods of time (pomodoro advocates 25 minutes of focused activity) and includes time for reviewing the work that's been done in that particular block of time.

I have typically managed work, not time. I have x projects to accomplish today so I estimate the time each will take and decide on the order to work on each one. I may or may not take breaks in the middle of a task. If a task takes longer than expected, I sometimes just keep hammering away, depending on whether I'm working to a deadline and/or think I'm close to finishing it. 

My strategy works...most of the time. If I'm way off on my estimates, I might get completely derailed and end up not finishing three things because one of them took a lot longer than I thought it would.

I like the idea from the counter-intuitive methods of increasing productivity blog about working on the things that interest me. I'm here to begin with because I think coding will be interesting. If I want to spend an hour reading the Learn Ruby the Hard Way book, that's productive time. If I want to take 10 minutes a day to meditate, that (apparently) will also be productive. I have the time and, since everything here is new, I can wallow a bit in the sense of shiny and interesting. Not to the exclusion of assignments, naturally, but...just because something may be separate from an assigned challenge, doesn't mean it's a waste of time.

Also, I know that I'm most productive before noon and between 2 and 4pm. My plan is to spend that time working on challenges, when my brain is working most effectively, and then pursue other interesting things outside of those periods.
