<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    I really enjoyed this challenge. I know that there are probably a million ways that I could have made this first draft more like the original site without using CSS (HTML tags that I don't know yet, I mean) but I still feel like I got to play around a bit and see how my changes to the code were being played out.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    Rabbit holes! I spent about 30 minutes on the element index of the html5doctor.com site. Couldn't alway find what I wanted but found a lot of other interesting stuff. That site seems great to demonstrate that html is always changing.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    Excellent - my site looks kind of terrible right now. I am really glad that one of the videos this week mentioned how important semantics are in html, especially if the site is going to be "read" out loud. I hadn't considered that before.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    As much as I'm sure I'll sometimes forget closing tags, I am finding them useful to differentiate elements. Some of these bullet points included text that was a link as well as text that was not meant to be a link and the </a> after the linking text makes the distinction pretty clear.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    I have a cheatsheet right now but I'm sure the tags I have on it today will be second nature to me by next week. I'm finding two things most handy: letting my text editor fill in my closing tag for me and keeping track of reference material online, like that element index.
