**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**
	1. *Information gathering.* Understanding the purpose of the site, whether the goal is to impart information, make money, inspire action or whatever. It's also important to consider who is the target audience of the site and what the content will be.
	2. *Planning.* Looking at how the site will flow, what viewers will see first and how they'll move from one page to another.Creating a site map, for example. 
	3. *Design.* Making mockups of the site, including colors, logos, overall look of the site. These might just be images, not live pages, or live pages with limited functionality. The idea is to give the client a clear picture of how the site will look before moving on to the next step.
	4. *Development.* Actually coding the site. Usually begin with the home page and then create a template for interior pages so their look is consistent.
	5. *Testing & delivery.* Testing involves making sure the site works as it's meant to, including any forms or scripts. Also checking to be sure that it functions well on different platforms and devices. May include search-engine optimization through the use of titles, descriptions, keyword tags. Delivery is getting the web files to the client's server.
	6. *Maintenance.* It's important to keep the site updated as either the client's desired content changes with new products or services or to keep it flowing properly as new platforms gain usage or popularity.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose?**
My site's goal is to inform potential employers about my areas of expertise both through explanation in the "about me" section and example in the "projects" and "technical blog" sections. 

**What kind of content will your site feature?**
It will feature both biographical information about my background, location and contact information as well as blog entries and examples of my work. At the moment, these are all pretty static web pages, using text and images without much in the way of interactive elements. I expect that will change in the future.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
Their interest, I hope, is in hiring a qualified employee. My site is designed to show my skills as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Its overall design, as well as the projects I include, is an indicator of my skills.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
I want users to view information and then contact me to offer me a great job. At the very least, I want users to get a good idea of what I can do.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
It's important! And it's hard to quantify well because good user experience design varies from one site to another. 

One of the points I found most interesting were that the user experience can't really be tracked by traditional methods. It's not enough to show that people stay on your site or not, you would have to do additional surveys or comparisons of alternate site designs (or other things) to really understand whether users are getting the most from your site. 

Another thing I noted was that UX design is not the same as usability. A site could be operationally excellent and still deliver poor user experience.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
User experience design is the process of determining how users respond to your website and improving their overall experience. It's important to understand viewers' reactions to the site so that you can accomplish whatever it is you're trying to do. For example, if you are selling goods but buyers have trouble finding your check out page, you won't get many sales.

Besides basic usability, there are more subtle elements of the user experience. We're used to seeing certain types of information presented in specific ways, tabs for example to navigate between different pages or a slide show of images. If your site uses an unusual pattern for these typical actions, the user may be confused or even just vaguely uncomfortable. I'm looking forward to checking out darkpatterns.org to see some of the deceptive tactics they track!

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
The only thing I found tedious was the very long list of resources at the end of the *Smashing Magazine* article "What is User Experience Design." I made a note of some of them but the list was so long that I wasn't really taking in the resources listed at the end. I'd have appreciated a more curated list.
