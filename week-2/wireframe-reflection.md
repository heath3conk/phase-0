**What is a wireframe?**
A wireframe shows the structure of a webpage. By simplifying the various elements, you can show where each piece will fit in relation to the others, how they'll interact and get an understanding of how the site will flow. That simplification seems to be the key: there's no reason at this point to have actual links, colors, pictures, etc. Including that much detail would actually reduce the effectiveness of the wireframe.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**
You can see how things will fit together. It's also a good place to make sure you're including all the elements you want to. It's like creating an outline for a written paper.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
Mostly. After a bit of an OS issue finding a tool that will work on Linux, I realized that my other, Windows, machine has MS Visio installed. So I used that and it worked great. It was a relatively easy way to get pieces into place and the standard wireframing tools Visio includes gave me some ideas for elements I might not have thought of otherwise.

I can definitely see how you could spend days doing this though. I was NOT able to limit myself to one hour for this challenge. I had barely gotten started at that point!

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
I stuck with my first idea, mainly. But I had looked at a gallery of other wireframes before hand so I had considered some other setups before I started drawing it out.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**
Two main questions:
1. How much detail should I include at this point? For example, if I want to have drop-down menus along the top of the page, should I show the items on those lists here? If not, how do I indicate that's what they are?
2. Overall, what design works for a site like this? I checked out this [gallery](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/50-fresh-portfolio-websites-for-your-inspiration/) of wireframes from *Smashing Magazine* for inspiration.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
I enjoyed falling down the rabbit holes (always like that) and looking at the wirefames other people have used. The only part I found tiresome was trying to get all the pieces to look the way I wanted them to in Visio. Sizing the little boxes, changing the font sizes, etc. Also, looking at what others have done is great and I want to be careful to not just copy their site. I'm still trying to figure out what my site will really look like...once I know how to make it do something other than just display text.
