/*
PERSON 1: USER STORIES

1. 	As a user, I want to have a function called 'sum' that takes a set of 
	numbers and adds them up, producing their total as its output.

2.	As a user, I want to have a function called 'mean' that takes a set of
	numbers and calculates their average.

3.	As a user, I want to have a function called 'median' that takes a set
	of numbers and finds its median. (Since fifth grade was a while ago for me, 
	I looked this one up to get the specific definition of median and here's 
	what it says on www.mathisifun.com: "to find the median, place the numbers 
	you're given in order and find the middle number. If there are two middle 
	numbers, you average them.")

Note: each of these has to work regardless of how many numbers you're 
looking at, whether it's an even number or odd number of numbers.
